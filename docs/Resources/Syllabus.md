Syllabus for GEN220: High Throughput Biological Data Processing

Course Description
==================

This course focuses on computational skills for processing data using
programming language Python and UNIX environment. No prior programming
experience is required, but some basic computer skills will be useful.

With the advancement of high throughput data generation methods, a
major challenge that graduate students in life sciences have to face
today is to analyze large amount of biological data. The objective of
this course is to provide an opportunity for graduate students with no
computer science background to learn the basic skills of handling high
throughput biological data. It covers the Linux/Unix environment and
the importance of the com1mand line interface; the Python programming
language; program design, implementation, and testing; BioPython;
Strategies for analyzing genome resequencing, RNASeq, sequencing data.
Students build hands-on skills by analyzing real high throughput
biological data through homework assignments and team projects.

Grading
-------

* Programming Homework assignments (5 in total): 50% of grade
* Project: 50% of grade

Homework
--------

* Homework is due before class on the date listed in the syllabus or if amended when assignment is given.

* There will be a programming assignment every two weeks during the first half of the course.
  Programming assignments must be prepared along with any necessary input files or documentation to demonstrate program usage.

* Code should be runnable as turned in. You will deposit your code in
  your github repository or if not possible, by Canvas. You can make
  one private personal repository to deposit and should organize a
  folder for each homework assignment (e.g. hw1, hw2, hw3, hw4). There will be a link to create these through GitHub Classroom and posted in [Canvas](https://elearn.ucr.edu/courses/17733/assignments/syllabus) and Piazza.

  Technology Requirements
  -----------------------
  Because this course takes place online and requires use of a computer, you will need the following:

  ## Hardware

  Access to a current Mac or PC (with a fast processor and speakers)
  Webcam and microphone (to participate in any video components, e.g. live sessions, remote proctoring, video presentations)
  Software

## Operating systems:
  * OSX is recommended with [Xquartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) installed for X11
  * UNIX or Linux eg [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
  * Windows with [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)

## Other recommended software - a local text editor
 * [Atom](https://atom.io/) is highly recommended
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

Projects
--------

* Project Topics will be discussed in October and teams will select a project idea to focus on.

* Project will be 2-3 individuals working together.

* A presentation will be made by each team - last day(s) of class.

* A final report with the details will be turned in by the group.

* The report needs to detail what each person's contribution is to the
  project.
